  tagline: VOIX is a lightweight browser framework that lets you add AI assistants to any website using just HTML. You define tools with <tool> tags and provide state with <context>, and the VOIX Chrome extension turns these into structured API calls the assistant can use—without touching your layout, styles, or data privacy.
